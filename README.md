# dopastream
Dopastream is a browser extension that notifies you when Dopa goes live.

## Translation
I used i18n so the extension could be compatible with multi-language,
if you'd like to translate it, fork the repo, create a folder in both

- `Firefox/_locales`
- `Chrome/_locales`

This folder should be named after the locale's code see : https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/i18n?csw=1#localeTable
Then copy messages.json from the `_locales/en` folder into the new folder and start translating the messages, don't touch the description it is not shown.
Feel free to update this README to add yourself
When you're done make a pull request to this repository.

## Contribution
Every contribution to this repo is welcomed, try to keep it as consistent as possible, also same as translation, fork and PR to contribute.
